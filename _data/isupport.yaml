            Indicates that the `"caller-id"` user mode is supported, which
            rejects messages from unauthorized users. `"letter"` defines the
            mode character, which is used for this feature. If the value is not
            given, it defaults to the mode `"g"`.

            Indicates the method that's used to compare equality of
            case-insensitive strings (such as nick/channel names).
            Typical values include `"ascii"` and `"rfc1459"`. `"rfc3454"` is a
            proposed value that refers to the stringprep method described in
            [RFC3454](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3454) (typically used for
            UTF-8 casefolding).

            Indicates the maximum number of channels a client may join. Though
            a client shouldn't assume that other clients are limited to what
            they receive here. If `"number"` is empty, there is no limit.

        comment:
            Originally meant to specify the character encoding of messages sent
            by the server, but removed in a later version of the draft. It is
            meaningless nowadays and should be ignored.

            [`draft-brocklesby-irc-isupport-03`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brocklesby-irc-isupport-03)
            (2004) says, "The traditional CHARSET parameter has been entirely
            removed. It was found to be unworkable; a correct specification
            could not be devised to represent its meaning across
            implementations".

            [`draft-hardy-irc-isupport-00`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hardy-irc-isupport-00)
            (2005) removed it completely.

        comment: >
            Indicates that the server supports the [`"DEAF"`](usermodes.html#DEAF)
            user mode and the given character is used to represent that mode.

        examples:
            - "DEAF=D"

        comment: >
            Indicates that the server supports search extensions to the `"LIST"`
            command. For specific extension characters, read the linked Hardy
            draft and various IRC software.

        examples:

        name: ETRACE
        format: "ETRACE"
        origin: ircd-ratbox
        comment: >
            Indicates that the server supports the `"ETRACE"` command (IRC
            operators-only), which is similar to `"TRACE"`, but only works on
            nicknames and has a few different options. First introduced in
            ircd-ratbox-2.0beta2(r13975); mentioned in a [footnote of Hardy draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hardy-irc-isupport-00#page-25)
            without defining anything about it.

        examples:

        comment: >
            Indicates that the server supports "ban exemptions". The letter is
            OPTIONAL and defines the mode character which is used for this.
            When no letter is provided, it defaults to `"e"`.

        examples:
            - "EXCEPTS"
            - "EXCEPTS=e"

        information:
        comment: >
            Indicates the types of "extended bans" that the server supports.
            `"prefix"` defines the character that indicates an extban to the
            server and `"types"` is a list of characters indicating which
            types of extended bans the server supports. If `"prefix"` does not
            exist, then the server does not require a prefix for extended bans
            and they should be sent with no prefix.

            Extended bans may allow clients to issue bans based on account
            name, SSL certificate fingerprints and other attributes, based on
            what the server software supports. They may also be used in ban
            exemption and invite exemption masks, depending on server software.

        examples:
            - "EXTBAN=~,cqnr"
            - "EXTBAN=~,qjncrRa"
            - "EXTBAN=,ABCNOQRSTUcjmprsz"

        comment: >
            "Forced Nick Change". Indicates that the server may change a user's
            nickname without the user sending the server a `"NICK"` message.
            Note that servers may do this even if they don't send this token.
            Clients MUST be able to handle this correctly regardless of whether
            this token is presented or not.

        examples:
            - "FNC"

            Indicates that the server supports "invite exemptions". The letter
            is OPTIONAL and defines the mode character, which is used for this.
            When no letter is provided, it defaults to `"I"`.

        comment: >
            Indicates the maximum allowed length of a single IRC message (line)
            in octets. The `"LINELEN"` token defaults to 512. There is no upper

        comment: >
            Indicates support for the `"MAP"` command, which is used to
            show a representation of how the servers are linked to each other.

            In practice this is command is supported by most networks (but
            may be disallowed for non-IRC operators), even if they don't
            advertise this token. Used by InspIRCd up to 2.0, removed in 3.0.

            Indicates the maximum number of bans that may be set on a channel.

            `"MAXBANS"` was obsoleted by `"MAXLIST"`, as that token allows servers
            to specify which limits apply to which channel modes explicitly.

        comment: >
            Indicates the maximum number of channels a client may join. Which
            types of channels this limit does or doesn't apply to is not made
            clear by the token. This limit may only apply to standard (`"#"`)
            channels.

            The `"CHANLIMIT"` token was created to explicitly specify the limits
            that apply to each channel type. `"CHANLIMIT"` should be used instead
            of this token, but this token is still widely-defined by servers.

        examples:

            channel. The value MUST be specified and is a set of `"mode:number"`
            pairs, where `"mode"` is a number of `"type A"` modes that have been
            defined in `"CHANMODES"` and `"number"` is how many of this mode may
            be set. For more details, read the linked Hardy draft.

            For INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY and indicates the name of the IRC
            network that the client is connected to. A client SHOULD NOT use
            this value to make assumptions about supported features on the
            server.

        examples:
            - "NETWORK=EFNet"
            - "NETWORK=Rizon"

            Indicates the maximum length of a nickname that a client may use.
            Other clients on the network may have nicknames longer than this.

        examples:

            Indicates the channel membership prefixes available on this server
            and their order in terms of channel privileges they represent,
            from highest to lowest. If the value is not specified, then NO
            channel membership prefixes are supported by this server. Various
            prefixes used in production are contained in the ["Channel
            Membership Prefixes"](chanmembers.html) list.

        examples:
            - "PREFIX=(ov)@+"

            Indicates that the client may request a `"LIST"` command from the
            server without being disconnected due to the large amount of data.
            This token MUST NOT have a value.

        examples:

        comment: >
            Indicates that "secure listing" is enabled and that your initial
            request for a channel list on connect may be denied until you have
            been connected for a certain amount of time. Used by InspIRCd only.

        information: "https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hardy-irc-isupport-00"
        comment: >
            Indicates the maximum number of entries a user may have in their
            silence list. The value is OPTIONAL and if not specified
            indicates that there is no limit. The `"SILENCE"` command seems to
            vary quite a lot between implementations. Most clients include
            client-side filter/ignore commands and servers have the
            `"CALLERID"` client mode as alternatives to this command.

        examples:
            - "SILENCE=15"
            - "SILENCE="

            port/ip pairs are separated by semicolons (;). Used by InspIRCd up
            to 2.0, removed in 3.0.

        name: STARTTLS

        comment: >
            Indicates that the server supports upgrading plaintext connections
            to encrypted ones through `"STARTTLS"`. This token must **not** be used
            to detect STARTTLS support, since that means leaking the initial
            connection registration process. The ircv3.1
            [`"tls"`](http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/tls-3.1.html)
            extension should be used instead. Removed in InspIRCd 3.0.

        comment: >
            Indicates that the server supports a method for the client to send
            a message via the `"NOTICE"` command to those people on a channel
            with the specified channel membership prefixes. The value MUST be
            specified and MUST be a list of prefixes as specified in the
            `"PREFIX"` token.

        examples:
            - "STATUSMSG=@+"

            Attempts to indicate the standard to which the ISUPPORT
            implementation is written. Whether this means tokens or simply
            syntax is not specified. This doesn't seem to be that useful, given
            the age of all these specifications and how it is not officially
            specified nor used all that much.

        examples:

        comment: >
            Certain commands from a client MAY contain multiple targets. This
            token defines the maximum number of targets may be specified on
            each of these commands. The value is OPTIONAL and is a set of
            `"cmd:number"` pairs, where `"cmd"` refers to the specific command
            and `"number"` refers to the limit for this command.

            If the number is not specified for a particular command, then that
            command does not have a limit on the maximum number of targets.

            If the `"TARGMAX"` parameter is not advertised or a value is not sent
            then a client SHOULD assume that no commands except the `"JOIN"` and
            `"PART"` commands accept multiple parameters.

        examples:
            - "TARGMAX=PRIVMSG:3,WHOIS:1,JOIN:"
            - "TARGMAX="

        comment: >
            Indicates the maximum length of a topic that a client may set on a
            channel. Channels on the network MAY have topics with longer
            lengths than this.

        examples:

        comment: >
            Indicates that the `"NAMES"` reply message may be extended to contain
            the full hostmask of every user listed. Must NOT have a value.

            The IRCv3 Working Group recommends that the [`"userhost-in-names"`](http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/userhost-in-names-3.2.html)
            client capability is used instead of this token.

        examples:

    -
        name: USERIP
        format: "USERIP"
        comment: >
            Indicates support for the `"USERIP"` command, which is used to
            request the direct IP address of the user with the specified
            nickname.

            This might be supported by networks that don't advertise this
            token.

        comment: >
            Indicates that the server supports messaging channel operators,
            either through a command like `"WALLCHOPS #channel"` or a
            `"STATUSMSG"`-like notice like `"NOTICE @#channel"`, with most
            implementations only handling the latter.

            This command has been obsoleted by the `"STATUSMSG"` token and the
            `"STATUSMSG"` token seems to be more widely used.

        examples:
            - "WALLCHOPS"

        seealso: "STATUSMSG"
        obsolete: true

        comment: >
            Indicates that the server supports messaging channel voiced users,
            either through a command like `"WALLVOICES #channel"` or a
            `"STATUSMSG"`-like notice like `"NOTICE +#channel"`, with most
            implementations only handling the latter.

            This command has been obsoleted by the `"STATUSMSG"` token and the
            `"STATUSMSG"` token seems to be more widely used.

            Unlike `"WALLCHOPS"`, this wasn't included in any of the original
            drafts and it's much less common.

            Indicates the maximum number of nicknames a user may have in their
            watch list.

            The `"MONITOR"` command is aimed at being a more consistent
            alternative to this command and documentation for it may be found
            on the [IRCv3 website](http://ircv3.net/specs/core/monitor-3.2.html).
