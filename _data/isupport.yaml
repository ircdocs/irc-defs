            rejects messages from unauthorized users. `"letter"` defines the
            mode character, which is used for this feature. If the value is not
            given, it defaults to the mode `"g"`.

            Indicates the method that's used to compare equality of
            case-insensitive strings (such as nick/channel names).
            Typical values include `"ascii"` and `"rfc1459"`. `"rfc3454"` is a
            proposed value that refers to the stringprep method described in
            [RFC3454](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3454) (typically used for
            UTF-8 casefolding).

            Indicates the maximum number of channels a client may join. Though
            a client shouldn't assume that other clients are limited to what
            they receive here. If `"number"` is empty, there is no limit.

            channel type prefixes as specified in the RFC and as described by

        comment:
            Originally meant to specify the character encoding of messages sent
            by the server, but removed in a later version of the draft. It is
            meaningless nowadays and should be ignored.

            [`draft-brocklesby-irc-isupport-03`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brocklesby-irc-isupport-03)
            (2004) says, "The traditional CHARSET parameter has been entirely
            removed. It was found to be unworkable; a correct specification
            could not be devised to represent its meaning across
            implementations".

            [`draft-hardy-irc-isupport-00`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hardy-irc-isupport-00)
            (2005) removed it completely.

        comment: >
            Indicates that the server supports the `"CNOTICE"` command. This is
            an extension to the `"NOTICE"` command.

        comment: >
            Indicates that the server supports search extensions to the `"LIST"`
            command. For specific extension characters, read the linked Hardy
            draft and various IRC software.

        examples:

        comment: >
            Indicates that the server supports filtering extensions to the `"SILENCE"` command.
            If a value is specified then it contains the supported filter flags.

        origin: ircd-ratbox
        comment: >
            Indicates that the server supports the `"ETRACE"` command (IRC
            operators-only), which is similar to `"TRACE"`, but only works on
            nicknames and has a few different options. First introduced in
            ircd-ratbox-2.0beta2(r13975); mentioned in a [footnote of Hardy draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hardy-irc-isupport-00#page-25)
            without defining anything about it.

        examples:

        comment: >
            Indicates that the server supports "ban exemptions". The letter is
            OPTIONAL and defines the mode character which is used for this.
            When no letter is provided, it defaults to `"e"`.

        examples:
            - "EXCEPTS"
            - "EXCEPTS=e"

        information:
        comment: >
            Indicates the types of "extended bans" that the server supports.
            `"prefix"` defines the character that indicates an extban to the
            server and `"types"` is a list of characters indicating which
            types of extended bans the server supports. If `"prefix"` does not
            exist, then the server does not require a prefix for extended bans
            and they should be sent with no prefix.

            Extended bans may allow clients to issue bans based on account
            name, SSL certificate fingerprints and other attributes, based on
            what the server software supports. They may also be used in ban
            exemption and invite exemption masks, depending on server software.

        examples:
            - "EXTBAN=~,cqnr"
            - "EXTBAN=~,qjncrRa"
            - "EXTBAN=,ABCNOQRSTUcjmprsz"

        comment: >
            "Forced Nick Change". Indicates that the server may change a user's
            nickname without the user sending the server a `"NICK"` message.
            Note that servers may do this even if they don't send this token.
            Clients MUST be able to handle this correctly regardless of whether
            this token is presented or not.

        examples:
            - "FNC"

            Indicates that the server supports "invite exemptions". The letter
            is OPTIONAL and defines the mode character, which is used for this.
            When no letter is provided, it defaults to `"I"`.

        examples:

        comment: >
            Indicates the maximum allowed length of a single IRC message (line)
            in octets. The `"LINELEN"` token defaults to 512. There is no upper
            limit for `"LINELEN"`.

            An alternative to this token is the [oragono.io/maxline-2 capability](https://oragono.io/maxline-2),
            though that has now been deprecated.

        examples:
            - "LINELEN=512"

        comment: >
            Indicates support for the `"MAP"` command, which is used to
            show a representation of how the servers are linked to each other.

            In practice this is command is supported by most networks (but
            may be disallowed for non-IRC operators), even if they don't
            advertise this token. Used by InspIRCd up to 2.0, removed in 3.0.

            Indicates the maximum number of bans that may be set on a channel.

            `"MAXBANS"` was obsoleted by `"MAXLIST"`, as that token allows servers
            to specify which limits apply to which channel modes explicitly.

        comment: >
            Indicates the maximum number of channels a client may join. Which
            types of channels this limit does or doesn't apply to is not made
            clear by the token. This limit may only apply to standard (`"#"`)
            channels.

            The `"CHANLIMIT"` token was created to explicitly specify the limits
            that apply to each channel type. `"CHANLIMIT"` should be used instead
            of this token, but this token is still widely-defined by servers.

            channel. The value MUST be specified and is a set of `"mode:number"`
            pairs, where `"mode"` is a number of `"type A"` modes that have been
            defined in `"CHANMODES"` and `"number"` is how many of this mode may
            be set. For more details, read the linked Hardy draft.

            Indicates how many "variable" modes may be set on a channel by a
            single `"MODE"` command from a client. A "variable" mode is defined
            as being a `"type A/B/C"` mode as defined in the `"CHANMODES"` token.
            The value is optional and when not specified indicates that there
            is NO limit places on "variable" modes.

            indicates that there is no limit. The `"SILENCE"` command seems to
            vary quite a lot between implementations. Most clients include
            client-side filter/ignore commands and servers have the
            `"CALLERID"` client mode as alternatives to this command.

            to detect STARTTLS support, since that means leaking the initial

        comment: >
            Certain commands from a client MAY contain multiple targets. This
            token defines the maximum number of targets may be specified on
            each of these commands. The value is OPTIONAL and is a set of
            `"cmd:number"` pairs, where `"cmd"` refers to the specific command
            and `"number"` refers to the limit for this command.

            If the number is not specified for a particular command, then that
            command does not have a limit on the maximum number of targets.

            If the `"TARGMAX"` parameter is not advertised or a value is not sent
            then a client SHOULD assume that no commands except the `"JOIN"` and
            `"PART"` commands accept multiple parameters.
