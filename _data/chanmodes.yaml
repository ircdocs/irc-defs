        comment: >
            Limits the channel to only allow the given number of members to
            be in the channel while the mode is set. Nobody else is allowed
            to join the channel while the channel membership count is
            greater than or equal to the number given with the mode, however
            some implementations allow IRC operators to circumvent that
            rule. Most traditional implementations accept only a signed
            integer here (using atoi()), however some more modern
            implementations may accept an unsigned integer (i.e. strtoul()),
            or even have machine variations on whether a 32-bit or 64-bit
            integer is accepted.

            Marks the channel as private. Using this form, +p cannot be set
            with +s at the same time. Setting +p while +s is set turns off
            +s, and vice-versa. This is widely considered obsolete in favour
            of the secret mode (+s).

            This mode is used to prevent a channel from having no operator
            for an extended period of time. When set, any channel that has
            lost all its channel operators for a certain period of time
            automatically has some or all channel members given channel
            operator status. RFC2811 specifies this is only available to '!'
            channels, but some implementations are reported to use it on
            other channel types, since they use timestamping to avoid
            channel take-overs during network splits.
