            Limits the channel to only allow the given number of members to

            to join the channel while the channel membership count is
            greater than or equal to the number given with the mode, however
            some implementations allow IRC operators to circumvent that
            rule. Most traditional implementations accept only a signed
            integer here (using atoi()), however some more modern
            implementations may accept an unsigned integer (i.e. strtoul()),
            or even have machine variations on whether a 32-bit or 64-bit
            integer is accepted.

            Marks the channel as private. Using this form, +p cannot be set

            other channel types, since they use timestamping to avoid

            Re-oper list - a list of identities used as a hint for reop when
            a channel is opless for a long enough time. Only one of the
            matches is used for the reop.

            Marks the channel as secret. The channel will not appear in
            channel listings, the NAMES command will not list nicknames for
            users who are not channel members, and the channel will not
            appear in WHOIS unless WHOIS is called by a fellow channel
            member.
