# The following format is used through-out this file. The fields 'name' and
# 'prefixchar' are manditory, the others may or may not exist.
# 
# The 'clientcreate' field determins whether or not a normal client may
# create a channel of that type. If it's set to no, then the channel must
# be created some other way (such as a service, server, or even an operator).

            This channel type is known only to the server they are created
            on, and as such only clients on that server can join it. Each
            instance of this channel type is contained per server.

            This channel type is known to all servers that are connected to
            the network.

            These channels work similar to the '#' channels, except the name
            is prefixed not only with the '!' but also a set of alpha-
            numeric digits. This is an alternative to the time-stamp method
            of avoiding channel-takeovers during network splits.

            These unmoderated channels work almost exactly the same as '#'
            channels, except nobody can obtain channel operator status on
            them. Some implementations seem to set the channel mode to '+nt'
            upon creation, however most implementations act as if modes +nt
            are set but don't announce them as being set.

            This is a programmable channel type. Normal users cannot create
            channels of this type. Channels must be created by the software
            that controls them. The parameters of these channels are not set
            in stone, and are controlled entirely by software. This means
            '.' channels of different names may have different properties.
            The function of this channel type is to provide set channels
            which require rare features without channel mode bloat, or
            software bloat. By creating a new channel type it also avoids
            confusion with other channel types with fixed definitions.

            This is a proposed channel type for IIRC. This is available to
            all IRC networks visible on an IIRC network, and as such users
            from other networks can participate.
