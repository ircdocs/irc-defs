        comment: >
            Reply to STATS O (See RFC); The privileges field is an extension
            in some IRC daemons, which returns either the name of a set of privileges,
            or a set of privileges. The class extension field returns which
            connection class the o-line applies to (this is also know to be
            placeholders like "0" and "-1" when inapplicable.)
            ircu doesn't have the privileges field and irc2 uses it to display
            which port, if any, the oper is restricted to.

        comment: >
            Start of an RPL_ADMIN* reply. In practice, the server parameter
            is often never given, and instead the last parameter contains the
            text 'Administrative info about <server>'. Newer daemons seem to
            follow the RFC and output the server's hostname in the last
            parameter, but also output the server name in the text as per
            traditional daemons.

            When a server drops a command without processing it, it MUST use
            this reply. The last parameter text changes, and commonly provides the
            client with more information about why the command could not be
            processed (such as rate-limiting). Also known as RPL_LOAD_THROTTLED
            and RPL_LOAD2HI, I'm presuming they do the same thing.

            Displays text to the user. This seems to have been defined
            in irc2.7h but never used. Servers generally use specific
            numerics or server notices instead of this. Unreal uses
            this numeric, but most others don't use it

            Reply to WHO, however it is a 'special' reply because it is
            returned using a non-standard (non-RFC1459) format. The format
            is dictated by the command given by the user, and can vary
            widely. When this is used, the WHO command was invoked in its
            'extended' form, as announced by the 'WHOX' ISUPPORT tag. Also
            known as RPL_RWHOREPLY (Bahamut).

            Timezone name is acronym style (eg. 'EST', 'PST' etc). The
            microseconds field is the number of microseconds since the UNIX
            epoch, however it is relative to the local timezone of the
            server. The timezone field is ambiguous, since it only appears
            to include American zones.
